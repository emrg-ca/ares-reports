Hi

As summer draws to a close, some people are asking about EMRG activities for
this fall.

1) OARC Hamfest - This Saturday at the Carp fair grounds. Stop off at the EMRG
booth.

2) ARES SET - The Simulated Emergency Test (SET) is held every fall and is
meant to get ARES groups out for an exercise at least once per year. It is not
a requirement to participate in the SET on the specific dates. EMRG will
continue to schedule exercises based on when it is required and ready, so we
produce a quality exercise which gains value for our clients. Sometimes our
EMRG exercise dates overlap with the SET, but not this year.

3) Fall EMRG Meeting - The fall meeting has not been scheduled as we are still
working on the organizational activities regarding the future of EMRG, which we
spoke of at the last general meeting. (See presentations on the EMRG web site
under Meetings, in the Library section).

We have made some progress over the summer as usual. The West End repeater was
installed, updated technical reports for all our repeaters were sent to the
SLVRC and we have been planning our next steps for establishing the
organization of EMRG going forward.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.

Regards
Peter
