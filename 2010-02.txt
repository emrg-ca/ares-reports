 The Ottawa ARES group, a.k.a. EMRG or the ''Emergency Measures Radio Group'',
held a general meeting on February 27th at the Ottawa Fire Service Training
Centre.  We will be posting the slides from this meeting presentation on our
web site soon at http://emrg.ca.

Harold Hamilton (VA3UNK) presented a summary of the very successful Canadian
Ski Marathon--February 2010 marked the 44th year for this event--and told us
about some of the difficulties in trying to keep track of many hundreds of
skiiers in hilly, treed areas with little or no cell phone coverage.  Many EMRG
members regularly volunteer as radio operators at this event.  Much of the
organization for radio communications at the Canadian Ski Marathon would not be
possible without the efforts of: Harold Hamilton (VA3UNK), Clayton Jenkins
(VE3CBJ), Rick Furniss (VE3IHI), Mike Kelly (VE3FFK), Richard Hagemeyer
(VE3UNW) and many, many others.

Several new self-directed study modules were presented at the meeting.  These
modules are now available for download from the EMRG web site at
http://emrg.ca.  The modules available now are:  The Four Cs of Communications,
Crossband Repeaters, Logging, Message Handling, Introduction to CTCSS and
Personal Preparedness.  We encourage anyone to read these at their leisure and
would love to hear from others who wish to write new modules or offer valuable
improvements.

Jim Montgomery from the City of Ottawa's Office of Emergency Management also
gave a presentation and reminded us that the City knows who we are and that
they want very much to work with us.

Peter Gamble (VE3BQP) is stepping down as team leader of EMRG after 15 years;
Thanks, Peter, for your fabulous work.  Richard Hagemeyer (VE3UNW) will be
taking over this role from Peter.  As before, the team leader of EMRG may be
reached at <teamleader@emrg.ca>.  Peter will continue to be a valuable part of
EMRG but will now focus more on the roles of liason with the City of Ottawa and
with technical solutions for EMRG's permanent radio installations at several
key City of Ottawa official buildings and at the City of Ottawa Emergency
Operations Centre.
