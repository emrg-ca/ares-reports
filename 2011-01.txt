- The Prescott-Russell ARES group leadership team held their Executive Meeting on January 15th, at the La Chardo Restaurant in Alfred Ontario.  The purpose of the meeting was to review a blueprint of major activities and issues that the group will likely be involved in during 2011.  We discovered that 2011 promises to be extremely busy year. PR-ARES plans to provide volunteer assistance at 8 or more major community events including 2 Bicycle races, JOTA, Canada Day festivities, and the International Plowing Match. In addition to volunteer activities, PR-ARES will be holding an amateur radio basic course starting in February for a group of interested individuals and possibly another course in the Fall as part of an effort to expand the membership base. The PR-ARES leadership team also discussed major housekeeping issues to deal with in 2011 such as liability insurance options, the possibility of incorporating as a club, updating the PR-ARES web site and turnover of leadership staff.  These are not trivial issues and will require significant effort.   
- In 2011 radio amateurs in Prescott-Russell are invited to PR-ARES ''Triode Thursday'' meetings every week at the Chamberland Centre in Rockland's Simon Park from 6PM to 9PM followed by coffee at Tim Hortons.  Triode Thursday activities will continue to aim at typical club oriented activities of interest to all radio amateurs such as technical discussions, hands-on activities with equipment, contesting, homebrew equipment, guest speakers and power-point presentations. From time to time we will use a small portion of a Triode Thursday meeting to discuss logistics for an upcoming ARES events.  Radio Amateurs in Prescott-Russell should also consider joining the PR-ARES Yahoo Group as a way of keeping informed of local activities.
- The PR-ARES weekly VHF net takes place every Tuesday on VA3PRA, the Alfred Ontario Repeater (145.47-) or VE3PRV, the Clarence-Rockland repeater (147.33+).  Nets take place at 8PM while clocks are on Eastern Standard time, and moves to 9PM after March 13 when clocks are on Daylight Savings time.  This is a formal net and we invite any interested radio amateur to check in.
