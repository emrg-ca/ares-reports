Hello ARES ECs,

Please share with your leadership team so that they are all in the loop as to
what transpirers in other parts of the District.  You may by all means share
such reports with your entire group membership.  It's all good info they can
use.

Cheers,

Mike VE3IPC

The Renfrew county ARES group had an impromptu exercise as the Red Cross caused
us to exercise our call tree on Sat. morning Mar. 12th.  AEC Richard VA3BIX
went to the Red Cross building in Pembroke to set up a 2 Meter station using
the permanently installed antenna we have there.  Meanwhile, the call tree was
completed and a net was started at 09:50 on the VE3NRR RPT.  At some point
during their exercise routine, the Red Cross staff in the Pembroke office
assembled in the room with AEC Richard and his radio and each of the 20 ARES
members that were on the net gave name, Callsign and location.  When all was
done, we were given a standing ovation by the Red Cross staff (there were no
chairs for them in the room).

On Mon. Mar 21st, John Potter from the Pembroke Red Cross gave a presentation
of the Red Cross activities to the Renfrew County Amateur Radio Club. Some
discussion followed on the communication requirements of the Red Cross and how
we might be able to help them. They are particularly interested in packet. We
have a TNC for them and are looking to set up a packet station with Outpost
that will live permanently at the Red Cross building.

The Cornwall ARES Group held their meeting on March 30, 2011 which was a very
full and enjoyable meeting.

- The construction of the new EOC in Cornwall continues. The opening has again
  been delayed from the end of February 2011 to sometime in April 2011.

- The April 1 meeting of the Emergency Management Committee meeting has been
  delayed and with no new date given to allow the members to see the new EOC.
None ARES members of SVARC were also invited to attend.

- The Cornwall group held an ARES equipment training session on March 26 at the
  Cornwall Armoury.  9 ARES radio operators attended this session in which we
had two functional Yaesu 8800 stations on which to practice.  Feedback was
positive.

- Soon the EC will announce a new date for a full ARES exercise in Cornwall.

The Ottawa ARES [EMRG] group performed a successful and fun mini-callout and
go-kit exercise.  This was a chance to test out phone numbers and/or email
addresses provided by our members and to put into effect our callout
procedures.  Members were given a couple days warning and asked to bring a
go-kit suitable for a 72-hour deployment simulating a neighboring district
mutual aid request.  Further discussions about go-kit essentials and other
upcoming mini-exercise plans were presented at the most recent general meeting
on March 5th.

The go-kit list can be viewed at <

The Eastern Ontario [Seaway/Capital] ARES District is planning an ARES Mutual
Aid deployed exercise on April 16th in Ottawa and will be similar to last
year's, but with a few twists.  This year the staging area will be at a much
different location and there will be Radio Ops coming in to register for duty
as replacements and there will be Radio Ops that will be signed out and be off
duty for their rest period.  Though the main focus will be on the staging area
aspect of the exercise to test the lessons learned from last year's exercise, a
few other things will be also tested this year.

- Please note that this will be the last time that we at the District level
  will be conducting the ARES District Mutual Aid assistance deployed exercise.
It will be time for the ARES groups to then conduct their own exercises for the
next few years, local at first and later with each other neighboring ARES
groups.  The hope here will be that ALL ARES groups will become proficient at
using the ARES DMAP manual process that is put in place and be in full
readiness for an ARES Mutual Aid deployment in either invoking or responding to
the call for help.
