May 19 Low water advisory
Due to a failure of a major pipe carrying potable water to the south end of
the city, that area has had water use restrictions imposed.
As part of their contingincy planning, the City Office of Emergency
Management asked if EMRG would be interested in providing communications
between water distribution points, as an opportunity to activate EMRG.
(We haven't had to activate, so far)

Coming in June: Rideau Lakes Bicycle tour (Ottawa-Kingston-Ottawa),
Grandville (Canadian Emergency Management College) session
and, of course, many Field Day operations across Ottawa.

It's been a busy month 73 mk VE3FFK (taking over reproting from VA3DGN)
