- The Renfrew County West (RCW)-ARES group EC Bob VE3YX activated the Town of Laurentian Hills’ EOC HF station VE3TLH, on October 12th, for the EOC SET.  Two messages were sent to the PEOC, and one received using RMS Express with Winmor connecting to an RMS on HF.  Also, one formal voice message was received and a formal reply was sent.
- On Oct. 15th, the East & West Renfrew County ARES groups exercised the ARES District Mutual Aid Program (DMAP). The East group devised an emergency that overstretched their resources.  RCE-ARES AEC Jim, VA3JER called RCW-ARES EC Bob, VE3YX with the "Request for Mutual Aid" in a call for help.  RCE Jim provided RCW Bob with the info to complete the Request form.  Bob then activated the RCW-ARES phone tree and called a net on the local repeater, VE3NRR.  Ten members of the RCW-ARES group joined the net and after being updated with the nature of the exercise emergency and the requirements for respondents, indicated their availability to lend assistance. The distances our group members would have to travel to actually attend the exercise location made it impractical to do so. In an actual event, each responder would fill out a personal info form to be submitted on arrival at the staging reception area site.  In our exercise, each responder provided the info to Bob on the net.  Bob then filled in the forms and emailed them to the RCE-ARES group for them to proceed with an imaginary deployment.  At this point, we concluded the exercise.
- The exercise tested the phone tree, and gave the respondents an opportunity to think about what equipment and supplies they would need for their deployment.
- The RCW-ARES group members that responded were: Tony, VA3HWH; Rob, VA3AGN; Yvonne, VE3RYA; Dale, VA3DNA; Chris, VA3CRL; Mike, VE3ODJ; Richard, VA3BIX; Brodie, VA3BDT; Bernie, VA3SUR; and EC Bob, VE3YX.
- The RCW-ARES group one again has provided extra eyes for the Pembroke 
Police during Goblin night and Halloween night.  Fortunately, both nights were very quiet.
Participants were: Fred, VA3FPB; Mike, VE3ODJ with daughter Cloe; 
George, VE3GPD; and Dale, VA3DNA.

The Ottawa ARES [EMRG] group saw a quiet September.  Members of the group and other amateurs were able to support two days of emergency exercises at the Canadian Emergency Management College campus in Ottawa. This time the students were municipal officials from smaller French speaking communities across the country.  Mike – VE3FFK who coordinates the radio amateurs for the college has already recruited half the amateurs needed for the next exercises in November, and he is confident he will be able to find volunteers for December and February as well.  If you are curious to see what it's all about, please visit < http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/em/cemc/04pgc_01-eng.aspx#a02 > for info on the College, and < http://www.emrg.ca/Collegeville_Orientation_Guide.pdf > for info about the amateur radio side of the courses.  The college provides accommodation and mileage for its amateur volunteers, so consider volunteering if you are within driving distance of Ottawa.

- The Renfrew County East (RCE)-ARES group on September 12-2011, as part of a municipal exercise, the group was requested to provide radio communications assistance to the Township of Greater Madawaska.  This involved the setting up of a dual band radio station in the Municipal Office at Calabogie in Renfrew County.  As this township is one of the largest in Renfrew County and at 1011 square kilometers it incorporates the villages of Calabogie, Griffith, Matawatchan, Mount St. Patrick and Dacre Ontario, that this communications test was very necessary to test voice comms capabilities from extreme ends of the township.  The results of this comms test would be very important to township officials.
- Two of the group’s members AEC Ron VE3JRN (retired Fire volunteer) and the townships communications officer Wayne VE3JSQ were unavailable to conduct the comms test, who normally either or both would have been asked to conduct the amateur radio communications tests for the Township.  This gave the chance for Jim VA3JER (retired Fire Volunteer) to get some experience as acting (A/EC) EC.
- A/EC Jim was left in charge of the operation and enlisted the help of Sandy VE3AAC, Allan VE3JGU, with Renfrew County West (RCW)-ARES AEC Richard VA3BIX handling net control.  RCE-ARES EC Paul - VA3COG (OPP Staff Sergeant) was also a comms exercise participant.  The exercise duration was from 10:00 to 13:00 hours local time.
- With the amateur radio equipment in place A/EC Jim was asked by Fire Chief Betsy Sayer to participate in emergency exercises scheduled for September 12, 2011.
- The township’s first scenarios did not require ARES to pass traffic.  The second scenario operation ‘Wet Feet’ required amateur radio due to (exercise scenario) collapse of telephone communication.  Group members Sandy and Allan were dispatched to the Village of Griffith where (exercise said) severe flooding was occurring due to a break in the Bark Lake Power Dam.  The team was also sent to hamlet of Matawachan to set up mobile communication.  When the evacuation of Griffith was ordered, net control Richard VA3BIX contacted George VE3GPD in Petawawa who contacted the Pembroke Fire Chief, Don Horbach on the department response vehicle.
- Many Ottawa Valley stations responded to our roll call including Steve VE3KEG in Calabogie, Lewis VE3QJ in Pembroke, Wally VE3GE in Stewartville and Mike VA3TJP in Sand Point.
-The group was able to activate the auto patch at Pembroke and contact the IRLP Ontario Public Service Reflector.
- The next exercise for Greater Madawaska was scheduled for September 25, 2011, Fire Chief Betsy Sayer informed the ARES acting EC Jim that they would not be required as she is very satisfied with the results of the September 12, 2011 exercise and feels that ARES has a high level of organization, training and experience and the time will be better spent exercising the other people involved in this township.

- The Renfrew County East (RCE)-ARES group conducted an exercise on Saturday October 15, 2011, starting at 10.00 AM that included invoking the ARES District Mutual Aid Plan (DMAP) to gain some experience with it at both ends of the telephone line.  The local exercise morphed into including the need to invoke the Mutual Aid plan as A/EC Jim VA3JER developed the scenario and phoned Bob VE3YX, Renfrew County West ARES EC in a call for help, whereby the RCW’s EC activated the RCW group’s phone tree and activated the group’s NET on the VE3NRR RPT and on the Foymount Ontario RPT VE3UCR. 
- With the RCW group’s phone tree activated, calls from various stations answered the call for help and proceeded to assess and organize their combined resources to meet the need requested.  Once this had been done, the results were sent in by email to RCE group’s Acting EC letting Jim know what help was being committed, which was10 members from Renfrew County West ARES group.
- The SET was a success and a stand down order was issued at 12:00 noon.  Thanks to everyone who responded.

+ The Prescott Russell (PR)-ARES group conducted their yearly Goblins Patrol on Oct 31st 2011, which took place in many areas within the United Counties of Prescott-Russell.  For the past several years the PR-ARES group has been formally assisting the OPP in areas needed to be covered where the OPP might be thin.  In a meeting where Henry VA3OV (previous group EC) and Hawkesbury OPP Constable Pierre Dubois, a list was provided with areas for the PR-ARES group to patrol.  The start time was 17:10 and ended with no reportable incidence at 21.15 hrs daylight savings time.
- Locations patrolled by 8 mobiles in Prescott-Russell were;  L’Orignal, Alfred, Plantagenet, Rockland, Clarence Creek, Hammond, Bourget & Cheney.  Several ARES patrol units were used to patrol Clarence-Rockland region, and one unit patrolled 3 village areas further north.
- Thanks go to the following group member participants of the Goblins Patrol, which was professionally conducted with mobile stations, were the following; Ron VA3RRZ, George VA3SUS, Mike VE3IPC, Mike VE3LTM, Jim VA3KV, Chris VA3NKE together with Norm VA3NPL, Harry VA3ZAK, Allan VA3ONN, and Yvon VA3YGO (fix station) that the Goblins Patrol operation was a great success.
- Thanks go to Don VE3RM, who once again professionally conducted the Goblins Patrol net operation, which this year was carried out on the VA3PRV RPT - 147.330 Mhz located near Hammond Ontario, as the Alfred RPT was down awaiting repairs.
+ + The Prescott-Russell (PR)-ARES Group was activated on Wednesday October 12-2011 to provide communications for the City of Clarence-Rockland and the Russell Fire Department.  In Clarence-Rockland, the participating group members set up a command post at the Chamberlain Centre building where they had installed and activated communications via VHF, voice (using the group’s VE3PRV repeater on 147.330 MHz) and packet (using the VE3OCE Digipeater and Peter VE3BQP’s Winlink node – both located in Ottawa) to pass radio traffic locally and through the Winlink system to the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre (PEOC) in Toronto.  The group members also set up an HF (long range) radio station to prove that the PR-ARES group could communicate through packet to one of the HF packet nodes.  At Russell Ontario, we tested the VHF/UHF antenna installed on the Fire Hall’s communications tower.  It worked as planned and messages were passed between the Fire Hall and our command post.  Joining us to ask questions and review our progress was the CEMC and Fire Chief of the City of Clarence-Rockland, Pierre Sabourin.  He expressed interest in our capabilities and how he saw our group could provide aid to the community in a time of need.  He also expressed an interest in our group joining the city in their next city wide exercise. 
- Thanks go to the following members of PR-ARES Group who were involved that day: Harry VA3ZAK, Ron VA3RRZ, Norm VA3NPL, Jim VA3KV and (interim) group EC Lance VA3LP.
