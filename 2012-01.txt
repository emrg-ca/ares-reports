The Renfrew County West (RCW)-ARES group meeting was held in Petawawa on Jan
30th. The date turned out to be a poor choice as a number of members were
unable to attend.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the operation of
Outpost and to introduce the ICS-213 forms feature of Outpost.  Some of the
planned demos were thwarted by the intermittent operation of the Petawawa
Library WIFI. This demonstrated that if the use of the ICS-213 forms was
important, a backup WIFI router would be a good idea. The normal operation of
Outpost does not use WIFI.

=============================================================

The Ottawa [EMRG] ARES group repeater test was conducted by Dave, VE3KMV on
Wednesday with a good turnout; thanks to the participants Ron VA3ACZ, Bob
VA3QV, Arthur VA3BIT, Sandy VE3AAC, Mike VE3KOY, and Barney VA3BGB.  The report
from Dave is that all repeaters are operating normally.  In addition the EMRGâ€™s
Winlink and BBS systems, and the Ottawa ARC repeater, VE2CRA, were tested and
found to be working.  Other than these, there was no EMRG / Ottawa ARES
activity in January.

- The next events coming in February are the Collegeville EOC and Incident site
  courses that are conducted at the Canadian Emergency Management College in
Ottawa on February 8th and 9th.  Coordinator for the Amateurs, Mike - VE3FFK,
is happy to report that he has a full slate of volunteers for the exercises.

- Immediately following that on February 11 and 12 (Feb 10, 11 and 12 for some
  of us) is the Canadian Ski Marathon that is conducted in the Quebec mountain
regions, known as "Field Day North" to the local hams, because of it's
requirement for long operating hours, high volumes of tactical traffic,
unpredictable weather, and stringent requirements for station placement and
reliability. It is an excellent test of an operator's resourcefulness. Since
operators are assigned in pairs, it is an excellent chance to introduce
newcomers to public service event radio.
