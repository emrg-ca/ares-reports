The activity at EMRG / Ottawa ARES in July was the monthly test of repeaters on
July 4.  All six repeaters (5 EMRG plus club repeater VE2CRA) were functioning,
as were the Packet BBS and Winlink system.  Thanks to Dave, VE3KMV for
organizing the test program and this month's participants, Arthur VA3BIT, Mike
VE3FFK, and Ron VA3ACZ.  Our EC, Richard, VE3UNW also updated the mutual aid
information circulated to the neighbouring ARES groups to facilitate
communications between groups in the event of a mutual aid call.

73, Mike Kelly VE3FFK, reporting for  EMRG / Ottawa ARES EC, VE3UNW
