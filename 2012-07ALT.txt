Monthly Report to July 31, 2012


Seaway Valley Amateur Radio Club (SVARC) Inc.
Close association with the SVARC continues.   However, the club is on holiday’s until our next meeting planned for Sep. 26, 2012.      

Official ARES Bulletins
These bulletins continue to be read by the EC and Net Controllers on Mondays at 7:00 PM local on the club’s local 2-Metre net on VE3SVC (147.180MHz.+).  

Field Day
The SVARC participated in Field Day 2012 thereby exercising our emergency preparedness.

Expansion to SD&G ARES
Our expansion to “GD&G ARES” from the former “City of Cornwall ARES” continues.  The next step is for the EC to send letters to several community leaders and CEMC’s advising them of the expansion.  The first letter goes to the Township of South Stormont which has its next meeting on August 15, 2012. 

Hospital Emergency Communications
Our plans to provide emergency services to the Glengarry Memorial Hospital continue.  

Liaison with Township of North Glengarry
Following a warm reception by the CEMC for Alexandria – Guy Vaillancourt - this opens additional opportunities for ARES.  We will be providing an equipment recommendation to him shortly.
