Eastern Ontario ARES District July report

City of Ottawa, Counties of Prescott-Russell, of SD&G, of Leeds Grenville, of
Lanark and of Renfrew. 

Though it is the summer time, we have 4 group activity reports for you
and we have also added the latest RAC bulletin regarding the Ontario
Section restructuring progress.  The boundaries for all 4 new Sections
have been worked out and are now made available to all.

Please note: The District name has been changed from the 'Seaway /
Capital' to the 'Eastern Ontario' District.  This change should appear
in the next TCA Section News under Ontario, and the
http://ontario.racares.ca/ website will be reflecting this change in
near future.

This is done because EMO have been changing their boundaries several
time in 2012 with yet more to come.  The EMO Seaway Sector has been
deleted and the EMO Capital Sector has yet again changed in size and
so has the loyalist Sector, and others.  As this was forseen a few
years back when EMO began to do some changes ealsewhere in Ontario, we
decided then to start including the name Eastern Ontario ARES District
in preparation in our reports and documents for such changes as this.
Now that time has come and we are adoting this new name.

Because we have an organized District Mutual Aid association of ARES
groups for the geographical area that is normally known provincially
as Eastern Ontario, it makes perfect sense for us to adopt this mutual
aid model and abandon the EMO model.  It was a very good idea back in
2005 to align our boundaries with those of EMO and one benefit was
that the DEC could liaise with one EMO Field Officer for the same
geographic area.  That no longer makes sense with the continued EMO
boundary and name changes.  This is not to say that the District will
not continue to liaise with EMO, it's just that the District will need
to liaise with 2 EMO Field Officers instead of only one.

As far as we are concerned at the District level, it is business as
usual in supporting the same 6 ARES groups as in the past.

- The Prescott-Russell (PR)-ARES Group was involved again on July 1st of this
  year with protecting the fireworks site for the City of Clarence-Rockland
from intruders and wayward children. This year, due to our diligence in past
years, there were very few people trying to get close to the celebrity
fireworks presenter, Chuck Seguin of Wendover, who provided another spectacular
fireworks display for the local residents. Thanks go to Lance VA3LP, Henry
VA3OV, Ron VA3RRZ, Deb VA3VEG, Mike VE3LTN (including Gail and Christopher),
Chris VA3NKE, Harry VA3ZAK, Jim VA3KV and Allen VA3ONN (along with Suzanne) for
their all hard work to set up and guard the site. 

- The PR-ARES group received a request from the City of Clarence Rockland a
  week later and provided support for the Ottawa River Festival. Thanks go to
Harry VA3ZAK, George VA3SUS, Lance VA3LP and Jim VA3KV for their support. 

- Several Prescott-Russell members volunteered in mid July with the Optimist
  Club of Wendover for the ‘Wendover Country and Western Festival’. Thanks go
to Chris VA3NKE for coordinating this event and thanks go to Allen VA3ONN (and
Suzanne), James VA3JRP, and Lance VA3LP for volunteering. 

- The PR-ARES group provides support to both the City of Clarence-Rockland and
  Wendover (a village within the Township of Alfred and Plantagenet) as these
places provide homes for two of the group’s repeaters free of charge, VE3PRV
(Rockland) and VA3PRA (Alfred). If you pass through Eastern Ontario,
particularly on the 417 (old 17) east of Ottawa, you can use these VHF
repeaters on 147.330 MHz + (VE3PRV Rockland) and 145.470 MHz - (VA3PRA Alfred)
and say hello. Presently there is no tone on these two repeaters, but when they
do get updated, they will have a tone of 110.9 HZ, in and out. Things will be
quiet here in in this part of Eastern Ontario until the end of August when the
‘Bicycle Provincial Time Trials’ will take place. Here is wishing everyone a
wonderful summer.

===================================================

The Renfrew County East (RCE)-ARES group held a Call out on July 16 2012 with
The Greater Madawaska Fire Dept to test the reception of their radio tower set
atop the RCCA VE3STP RPT group’s tower on Kennedy Mountain at Mount St.
Patrick.  Involved with the group were several of the RCE-ARES group members at
different locations throughout the Renfrew township.  There were 5 more members
at Frie Station #2 on Highway 41 that helped out; Alan VE3JGU, Don VE3DON,
Donald VE3PM, Bill VE3TUC, EC Ron VERJRN, & AEC Jim VE3JKV.  At Station #1
there were; Wayne VE3JSQ, John VE3DDN, Armand VE3SWO, Graham VE3AMN & AEC Jim
VE3JER.    The RCE-ARES group net control for the evening was Steve VE3KEG and
Sandy VE3AAC was at the repeater site.  The group members were sent out in Fire
Trucks with some minor set backs as to the setting up of the group’s portable
radios.  Things worked out well for the group members and for the Fire
Dept.  This will help the group have a better coverage on the VE3STP RPT.   
This was a good night that worked well, which provided us with an activated
‘call out’ for the RCE-ARES group, which helped to train new members in our
group first hand.

- The EMRG / Ottawa ARES group July activity was the monthly test of repeaters
  on July 4th.

All six repeaters (5 EMRG plus the club repeater VE2CRA) were functioning, as
were the Packet BBS and Winlink system.  Thanks go to Dave, VE3KMV for
organizing the test program and this month's participants; Arthur VA3BIT, AEC
Mike VE3FFK, and Ron VA3ACZ.

- The group’s EC, Richard VE3UNW also updated the mutual aid information that
  is circulated to the neighbouring ARES groups to facilitate communications
between groups in the event of a mutual aid call.

- The Sormont, Dundas & Glengarry (SD&G)-ARES group continue to enjoy a close
  association with the Seaway Valley Amateur Radio Club (SVARC) Inc.   Things
are quiet as the club is on holiday until their next meeting planned for Sep.
26, 2012.      

- The Ontario Official bulletins continue to be read by the EC and Net
  Controllers on Mondays at 7:00 PM local on the club’s local 2-Metre net on
VE3SVC (147.180 MHz.+) RPT.  

- Members of he SVARC & ARES group participated in Field Day 2012 thereby
  exercising their emergency preparedness.

-The SD&G-ARES group continues its efforts of expanding out into the tri-county
of SD&G from the former “City of Cornwall ARES”.  As a next step the EC plans
to send letters to several community leaders and CEMC’s advising them of the
expansion of the group’s Emcomm service.  The first letter goes to the Township
of South Stormont, which has its next meeting on August 15, 2012. 

- The SD&G-ARES group is making plans to provide hospital emergency
  communications to the Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria that is now
becoming a new client.  

- Following a warm reception by the CEMC for Alexandria in North Glengarry -
  this opens additional opportunities for ARES.  The group’s EC Earle VE3IMP
will be providing the CEMC with an equipment recommendation list shortly.
