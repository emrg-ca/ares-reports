Eastern Ontario ARES District August-2012 report
City of Ottawa, Counties of Prescott-Russell, of SD&G, of Leeds
Grenville, of Lanark and of Renfrew.

The Prescott-Russell ARES group had a slow August this year and after
a busy June and July, the Group's members needed the downtime to
reconnect with family and friends. Only one support tasking for the
group in August. One of our regional bicycle groups, "Ride With
Rendall", sponsored the provincial time trials again this year in
Clarence-Creek, ON. About 150 riders turned out to compete on a 20 KM
open road track. Some did a once around loop and some did twice
around. The PR-ARES Group used AR to provide advance warning about
riders cresting the final hill and coming through a major intersection
before crossing the finish line. As the intersection was still in use,
but controlled by local bylaw officers and ‘Ride With Rendall’
volunteers, this advance warning allowed smooth flow of traffic and
non interference of the riders as they raced for the finish line. Ron
VA3RRZ was at the top of the hill and passed the information on to Jim
VA3KV at the intersection. There was about 15 to 20 seconds from the
time the first warning was given until the rider passed the
intersection. Less than 10 seconds later the rider swished through the
finish line. Jim also provided the rider's number to the finish line
to help identify the rider for the ‘commisaires’ stationed there with
coordinator Lance VA3LP monitoring all communications. In addition,
Ray-Allen, VA3ONN and his wife Suzanne were available as spares for
our weary communicators as well as performing a rover function around
the track. All went very well and all riders were accounted for at the
end of the day. Now the group will prepare for upcoming ARES training
in September for new members of the group and an exercise that will
test the mettle of the group as well as prepare them for a Mutual Aid
request from other groups in the district.  - - Looking forward to an
active fall this year.

The Renfrew County West (RCW)-ARES group EC is sad to report that
Bernie Surette, VA3SUR as SK.  The group lost an AEC, Bernie Surette,
VA3SUR to a motorcycle accident this month (not his fault). Bernie was
close to retirement and was one of the group’s core members.  Bernie
was also one of two VPs for the Renfrew ARC.  He will be missed!
==============================================

The Ottawa ARES [EMRG] group held their monthly EMRG repeater test,
held on August 1
All six repeaters (5 EMRG plus club repeater VE2CRA) were functioning,
as were the Packet BBS and Winlink system.  Thanks to Dave, VE3KMV for
organizing the test program and this month's participants were; Arthur
VA3BIT, Mike VE3FFK, and Ron VA3ACZ.
- With Mike, VE3IPC moving on from DEC to Ontario East Section
Manager, we send him our thanks and congratulations on the
appointment, and look forward to seeing Lance, VA3LP in his new role
as District Emergency Coordinator for Eastern Ontario ARES District as
of September 1.

The Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry (SD&G)-ARES group’s expansion into
SD&G Tri-County from the former “City of Cornwall ARES” continues.  In
light of this, on Aug. 29, 2012 along with City of Cornwall CEMC, a
team of HAMs attended the former Cornwall City Hall EOC and the
Firehall on 2nd Street to remove the ARES equipment.  The equipment is
now at the home of the EC, ready for deployment to any of the
townships where the group will provide emergency services.
- The finalized version of the SD&G ARES agreement with the Township
of South Stormont was delivered by e-mail on Aug. 31, 2012.  There
council meets on Sep. 11, 2012.
- The group continues with plans to provide emergency services to the
Glengarry Memorial Hospital.
- The SD&G group’s EC Earle DePass is in Liaison with the Township of
North Glengarry following a warm reception by the CEMC for Alexandria.
 This opens additional opportunities for ARES.  The EC has provided
the CEMC with an equipment recommendation.
- The SD&G-ARES group enjoys close association with the Seaway Valley
Amateur Radio Club (SVARC) Inc.
However, the club is on holidays until the next meeting planned for
Sep. 26, 2012.
===============================================

The Lanark North Leeds (LNL)-ARES group had a slow August, group
activity wise.  The group enjoys a weekly 2 meter net in spite of the
summer’s low check-ins.  The LNL-ARES group also enjoys a good
attendance at the Saturday morning breakfasts, in Perth Ontario.  –
