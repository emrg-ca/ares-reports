~ May 2012 - Eastern Ontario ARES District report ~
Counties of Renfrew, of Lanark, of Prescott-Russell 
of Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry 
and the City of Ottawa 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Stormont-Dundas & Glengarry (SD&G)-ARES group (formally the Cornwall ARES group) held there group meeting at their new venue on June 7, 2012.  Their new venue is Room 5101, Cornwall Community Hospital, 840 McConnell Avenue, Cornwall Ontario.      
- The ARES group’s name change is reflective of the group’s expansion to other parts of county of SD&G.  The group EC plans on sending letters to several community leaders and CEMC’s advising them of the expansion in mid-June.
- SD&G-ARES is working on plans to provide emergency radio communications to the Glengarry Memorial Hospital.
- Following a warm reception by the CEMC for Alexandria – Guy Vaillancourt - this opens additional opportunities for ARES in SD&G.  We will be providing an equipment recommendation to him shortly.
- The Ontario Official Bulletins are read by the EC or Net Controllers on Mondays at 7:00 PM local on the club’s local 2-Metre net on VE3SVC (147.180MHz.+).

- The Ottawa (EMRG) ARES group assisted the Motorsport Club of Ottawa in
the running of the Lanark Highlands Forest Rally on May 5 2012.  Of the 34 participants, there were 11 EMRG/ Ottawa ARES members.
- Radio Amateurs assisting were; KC2WLN Gary, VA2VWM Chris, VA3ACZ Ron, VA3BDM Brian, VA3BIT Arthur, VA3BRS Bruce, VE3BVV Ray, VA3GLN Guylene, VA3HOL Doug, VA3IZY Mark, VA3JME Jamie, VA3KDV Kevin, VA3OHA Ian, VA3PTG Pete, VE3PYE Chris, VA3SJE Sylvain, VA3UNK Harold, , VE3BSM Brad,  VE3FFK Mike, VE3GFH Gord, VE3HHP Heidi, VE3HWL Norm, VE3IHI Rick, VE3JNE Jeannie, VE3QMJ Mat, VE3RKS Roger, VE3SWP Robert, VE3VPL Robert, VE3VRS Steve, VE3WOD Ross, VE3XFT Larry, VE3XGP Gord, VE3ZRG Robert, VE3ZTU Alan.
- Ottawa ARES group members provided public service the following day for the CNCYCLE - Children's Hospital event of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) was held on May 6 2012.
The 14 members working the event were; VA3BIT/3 Arthur bike mobile 35 km route, VA3DGN Tyler, 
VA3JME/3 Jamie bike mobile on 70 km route, VA3QV Bob, VA3UNK Harold, VA3VXN Margaret, VE3CPH Paul, VE3FFK Mike, VE3IHI Rick, VE3KMV Dave, VE3PSL Kevin, VE3SMF Stewart, VE3XRA Glen and VE3ZTU Alan.  There were other hams that were participating in, rather than operating the event. *Note that many operators, including both bicycle mobiles worked both events, requiring a short turn around and re-packing time. The bike mobiles had both voice and APRS capability. The hams in the command post had frequent requests for position reports from the police and organizers. They use the information we provide about the location of our sweep to judge when to open the roads to motorized traffic. 
- The Ottawa ARES group AEC Harold VA3UNK, AEC Mike VE3FFK and EC Richard VE3UNW conducted the ARES District Mutual Aid exercise, "Exercise Badger" on May 26 with the following six group member participants;  VA3DGN Tyler, VA3QV Bob, VE3IHI Rick, VE3KOY Mike, VE3XGP Gord,
and VE3ZTU Alan.  The small turnout of participants was expected, since it was held in the middle of a great summer weekend. It will probably be repeated in the fall.  In the debrief session, it was suggested that since Ottawa has the most experience conducting the exercise, we should take it "on the road" and conduct it for other groups in the Eastern Ontario ARES District. That way they could concentrate on Mutual Aid, and not have to become experts on the running of the exercise. Any GROUP takers?
- Coming up in June is the Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour, from Ottawa to Kingston and back, on June 9-10. This event requires three different ARES groups to work with each other as the pack moves along the route. In past years, severe weather has caused serious problems. Of course there is always the possibility of breakdowns or injuries on the route. Our service is certainly needed and much appreciated.
- While EMRG / Ottawa ARES doesn't hold a field day event of it's own, we feel that operating outside of your normal conditions is a good exercise of your flexibility and ingenuity. You also learn how others solve the problems that come up. We recommend that each of you get out to one of the field day sites on June 23-24. With so many clubs around, there are several to choose from in the Ottawa area.
- One item not mentioned last month was the Canwarn severe weather training session held in Ottawa on the same day as the ARES District meeting also in Ottawa. Several EMRG / Ottawa ARES members however did attend. The Canwarn training is recommended, but not required for our members.
- The May repeater test was conducted on Wednesday May 2nd by Dave, VE3KMV with Ron VA3ACZ, Bob VA3QV, Arthur VA3BIT and Tracy VA3TXN participating. Mike, VE3FFK checked the 
Winlink node and BBS and found both to be operating normally.

- The Prescott-Russell (PR)-ARES group was primarily occupied with preparing for our very busy June and July upcoming events. 
- Ron VA3RRZ and Jean VE3OKK have set up a dipole antenna at Higginson Tower in Vankleek Hill in preparation for FD.  Other members of the group, Don VE3RM, Norm, VA3NPL, Henry VA3OV and Jim VA3KV have been testing radios that will be used at the site. As well regular meetings on Thursday evening in Rockland at the Chamberlain Centre have been used to discuss all manner of subjects (logging software, radios, antennas, generators, batteries, public relations, media blitz) to prepare ourselves for FD. 
- Right after FD the group prepares to provide support to the City of Clarence-Rockland for Canada festivities and the Ottawa River Festival on the 6/7/8 July and is very busy preparing for these events. 
- A new interim group EC, Henry VA3OV, for the PR-ARES Group was identified at the end of May who is willing to take over the group’s coordination as of September 1st 2012 and his name has been presented to the DEC for formal approval. This step was necessary because as of the same date, Lance VA3LP will become the next DEC as of Sept. 1st 2012.
- The PR-ARES group EC (ADEC) Lance VA3LP and DEC Mike VE3IPC attended the Fire Fighters Mutual Aid Association meeting in the municipality of East Hawkesbury in Prescott-Russell County and presented information to them on the role of ARES and that we can provide supplemental communications to the communities throughout the United Counties of Prescott-Russell. 
- ADEC Lance VA3LP along with DEC Mike VE3IPC plan on attending the Emergency Management Ontario Sector meeting in Pembroke Ontario in early June, as the DEC has been accepted as a presenter.  
- Each Tuesday evening the PR-ARES Group has their regular Net alternately on the VA3PRA repeater (145.470MHZ -) and the VE3PRV repeater (147.330+) which averages about 7 to 10 amateurs each night. * Report provided by EC Lance – VA3LP.
 

DEC SPECIAL ANNOUNCMENT:  DEC Michael - VE3IPC has learned two very sad announcements; the first being that the Canadian Emergency Management College in Ottawa has been permanently closed by Public Safety Canada (PSC).  It has been in operation since the mid-1950s and has always needed volunteer radio amateurs.  This was always a great exposure for ARES leadership members about the workings of a live activated EOC and the workings of a declared Emergency Site.  The second is that PSC has also stated last month that the JEPP program has been terminated permanently. Both these announcements have been confirmed by EMO.  

- What that said, it is recommended that ARES leadership team members take the Ontario Basic Emergency Management (BEM) course in their local community when offered, and also to take the on-line the IMS-100 course.  Both of these courses give a recognized course certificate that municipal Emergency Management officials would respect compared to the ARES CEC.  All CEMCs and their Alternates are required to take at minimum these courses as part of their job.

- A third announcement is that the EMO Seaway Sector no longer exists as such as of June 06.  It is now all called by EMO as Capital Sector, but this now excludes Lanark County.  Lanark and Leeds Grenville now both become part of the EMO Loyalist Sector.  This does not affect the LNL-ARES groups as such as Lanark is a member group of the Eastern Ontario ARES Mutual Aid association.  From now on we will use the primary name of ‘Eastern Ontario ARES District’ as the EMO Sector boundaries are often changing and even their Sector names are changing, as demonstrated here.
